# Sentiment Analysis On Turkish Tweets

In this work, I examined sentiment analysis, sentiment analysis in Turkish texts, sentiment analysis with social media data. Then I developed an application where I used machine learning methods for sentiment analysis. 

In this application, I used a data set of tweets (user comments about gsm-operators) which are labeled negative or positive. After preprocessing the data, I reserved eighty percent of the data for training our model and the rest for testing. It is used 3 different statistical models to train and test the data. These are SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models. After applying the models, I calculated the f1Score values and compared the results. According to F1 scores, I got the best results when I used the SVM model.
